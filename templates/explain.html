	<h2>Weird things happen in quantum mechanics.</h2>
	<p>The main weird thing is that the outcome of quantum measurements is truly 100% totally random. Why is this weird?  Because nobody has ever been able to explain why one thing happens vs another. </p>
    <h3>What the hell are you talking thing about?</h3>
    <p>OK, lemme slow down.  In every scientific theory except quantum mechanics there is a notion of cause and effect.  Thing A leads to Thing B.  But physicists have gone to great trouble to prove that there is no way to predict certain events.  </p>
    <h3>So...</h3>
    <p>So this was kind of a bummer because for a long time physicists just accepted that there was no good reason for one thing to happen vs another. Most physicists just kind of said, OK, whatever</p>
    <h2>The Many-Worlds Interpretation</h2>
    <p>Over time though, another interpretation emerged called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">many-worlds interpretation</a>, which suggested that it isn't one thing or another randomly happening.  Instead, all the things that can happen do happen&mdash;it's just that all those things happen in different parralel realities, and our current mind only happens to exist in one. </p>
    <h2>Sci-Fi vs Reality</h2>
    <p>This (very real) idea has been picked up in a lot of sci-fi shows, but most of them miss one important detail.  The trick is that most things that happen in our life are not quantum mechanical events. Most quantum events happen on the tiny microscpic scale and when you average a lot of those events together, you end up with a world that behaves really normally (not so random). </p>
    <h2>Why I built this app</h2>
    <p>In order to make multiple parrallel universes where there are really cool differences, I have to inject quantum mechanical randomness into the real world.  By using this app, a person gets to choose one thing to do, but meanwhile, in a parallel universe they get to have another copy of themselves do another different thing.  </p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>There is this really <a href="https://qrng.anu.edu.au">cool lab</a> at the Australian National University that live streams quantum measurements on the web.  When anybody uses this app to make a decision, it queries one of their measurements and gets Thing A or Thing B. But since it's a quantum measurement, there is another universe where the very same result was the opposite. </p>
    <h3>Should I learn more about this?</h3>
    <p>Why don't you use <a href="/">the app</a> to find out!</p>
